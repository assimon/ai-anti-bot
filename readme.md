`Telegram` is a world-renowned, very convenient and elegant anonymous communication tool.        
However, due to the anonymity of the software, a lot of spam promotion information often appears in the group. We have no way to identify whether there is spam information in the group at all times.      
Fortunately, `Telegram` provides us with a very powerful `Api`. Now we can use `artificial intelligence` to automatically help us detect user behavior.     

If you are a group administrator of `Telegram`, you can directly deploy this project privately.     

If you are a `developer`, you can use this project to familiarize yourself with the interactive development of `Go language` and `Telegram`, so that you can use `Api` to develop your own robot later!
